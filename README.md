# Hello Fresh Landing Page

This repository contains the code for the final assignment of my Motion Design Course.
The assignment consisted of styling a web template to fit a certain brand image, while also adding Lottie-animations to make it come to life. Most of the HTML and CSS skills for this assignment were acquired in other courses, so the main focus here was to learn effective 2D animation for web purposes. I mainly used SVG elements to create my animations. We were also asked to make and edit a screencast and integrate it into our webpage. 
We got comfortable with Adobe After Effects, Premiere and Illustrator in this class.

You can visit the website [here](https://verbekeibe.github.io/Landing-Page-Hello-Fresh/). Have a look around! (One of the animations does not work on Github Pages for some reason, but it works when the repo is cloned locally).

Make sure to visit the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/VerbekeIbe/Landing-Page-Hello-Fresh/wiki) to learn more about the techniques used in this project.
